First of all, Install ATutor stand alone and verify it is working correct.


Next :

Simply copy the contents of the atutor directory into the root of your ATutor installation.

Next step is to install the Atutor component as you are used to install other components.

Within the config of the component just list the url of your original  ATutor installation.

Registered Mambo users will automatically be added to ATutor.
